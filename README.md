Quadcopters, are a special type of aerial vehicle (or drone) that consist of four driven propellers placed in a square formation with equal distance from the center of mass of the vehicle. The propellers in this particular formation allows the drone to move about in three dimensional space through select control of the rotation speed (or angular velocities) of the individual propellers.

We integrated CoppeliaSim, a virtual reality simulation software that allows the simulation of many robotic systems including quadcopters, along with MATLAB, to simulate the quadcopter in a 3D coordinate system.
